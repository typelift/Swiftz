/// An Arrow is most famous for being a "Generalization of a Monad".  They're probably better
/// described as a more general view of computation.  Where a monad M<A> yields a value of type A
/// given some context, an Arrow A<B, C> is a function from B -> C in some context A.  Functions are
/// the simplest kind of Arrow (pun intended).  Their context parameter, A, is essentially empty.
/// From there, the B -> C part of the arrow gets alpha-reduced to the A -> B part of the function
/// type.
///
/// Arrows can be modelled with circuit-esque diagrams, and indeed that can often be a better way to
/// envision the various arrow operators.
///
