/// A Category is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of objects and a set of morphisms
/// between those objects.  Each object includes an identity morphism, and composition of morphisms
/// is the primary reason categories are such powerful abstractions.
///
/// Here, a Category is some class of Kind * -> * -> * that you can think of as modelling an "arrow"
/// from A -> B.  This means that if we provide a composition function, `•`, we can hook up
/// Categories from A -> B with Categories from B -> C and get Categories from A -> C.  This
/// function is also called >>>.
