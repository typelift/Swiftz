Swiftz
======

Swiftz is a Swift library for functional programming.

It defines functional data structures, functions, idioms, and extensions that augment 
the Swift standard library.

For a small, simpler way to introduce functional primitives into any codebase,
see [Swiftx](https://github.com/typelift/Swiftx). 

Introduction
------------

Swiftz draws inspiration from a number of functional libraries 
and languages.  Chief among them are [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz),
[Prelude/Base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base), [SML
Basis](http://sml-family.org/Basis/), and the [OCaml Standard
Library](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/stdlib.html).  Elements of
the library rely on their combinatorial semantics to allow declarative ideas to
be expressed more clearly in Swift.

Swiftz is a proper superset of [Swiftx](https://github.com/typelift/Swiftx) that
implements higher-level data types like Arrows, Lists, HLists, and a number of
typeclasses integral to programming with the maximum amount of support from the
type system.

To illustrate use of these abstractions, take these few examples:

**Lists**

```swift
import struct Swiftz.List

//: Cycles a finite list of numbers into an infinite list.
let finite : List<UInt> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let infiniteCycle = finite.cycle()

//: Lists also support the standard map, filter, and reduce operators.
let l : List<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

let twoToEleven = l.map(+1) // [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
let even = l.filter((==0) • (%2)) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
let sum = l.reduce(curry(+), initial: 0) // 55

//: Plus a few more.
let partialSums = l.scanl(curry(+), initial: 0) // [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55]
let firstHalf = l.take(5) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let lastHalf = l.drop(5) // [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

**Semigroups and Monoids**

```swift
let xs = [1, 2, 0, 3, 4]

import protocol Swiftz.Semigroup
import func Swiftz.sconcat
import struct Swiftz.Min

//: The least element of a list can be had with the Min Semigroup.
let smallestElement = sconcat(Min(2), t: xs.map { Min($0) }).value() // 0
 
import protocol Swiftz.Monoid
import func Swiftz.mconcat
import struct Swiftz.Sum

//: Or the sum of a list with the Sum Monoid.
let sum = mconcat(xs.map { Sum($0) }).value() // 10

import struct Swiftz.Product

//: Or the product of a list with the Product Monoid.
let product = mconcat(xs.map { Product($0) }).value() // 0
```

**Arrows**

```swift
import struct Swiftz.Function
import struct Swiftz.Either

//: An Arrow is a function just like any other.  Only this time around we
//: can treat them like a full algebraic structure and introduce a number
//: of operators to augment them.
let comp = Function.arr(+3) • Function.arr(*6) • Function.arr(/2)
let both = comp.apply(10) // 33

//: An Arrow that runs both operations on its input and combines both
//: results into a tuple.
let add5AndMultiply2 = Function.arr(+5) &&& Function.arr(*2)
let both = add5AndMultiply2.apply(10) // (15, 20)

//: Produces an Arrow that chooses a particular function to apply
//: when presented with the side of an Either.
let divideLeftMultiplyRight = Function.arr(/2) ||| Function.arr(*2)
let left = divideLeftMultiplyRight.apply(.Left(4)) // 2
let right = divideLeftMultiplyRight.apply(.Right(7)) // 14
``` 

**Operators**

See [Operators](https://github.com/typelift/Operadics#operators) for a list of supported operators.

Setup
-----

To add Swiftz to your application:

**Using Carthage**

- Add Swiftz to your Cartfile
- Run `carthage update`
- Drag the relevant copy of Swiftz into your project.
- Expand the Link Binary With Libraries phase
- Click the + and add Swiftz
- Click the + at the top left corner to add a Copy Files build phase
- Set the directory to `Frameworks`
- Click the + and add Swiftz

**Using Git Submodules**

- Clone Swiftz as a submodule into the directory of your choice
- Run `git submodule init -i --recursive`
- Drag `Swiftz.xcodeproj` or `Swiftz-iOS.xcodeproj` into your project tree as a subproject
- Under your project's Build Phases, expand Target Dependencies
- Click the + and add Swiftz
- Expand the Link Binary With Libraries phase
- Click the + and add Swiftz
- Click the + at the top left corner to add a Copy Files build phase
- Set the directory to `Frameworks`
- Click the + and add Swiftz
 
**Using Swift Package Manager**

- Add Swiftz to your `Package.swift` within your project's `Package` definition:

```swift
let package = Package(
	name: "MyProject",
	...
	dependencies: [
		.package(url: "https://github.com/typelift/Swiftz.git", from: "0.0.0")
		...
	],
	targets: [
		.target(
            name: "MyProject",
            dependencies: ["Swiftz"]),
        ...
	]
)
```

System Requirements
