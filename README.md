Swiftz
======

Swiftz is a Swift library for functional programming.

It defines functional data structures, functions, idioms, and extensions that augment 
the Swift standard library.

Setup
-----

Swiftz comes in two distinct flavors: Core and Full.  Swiftz Core is a smaller 
and simpler way to introduce pure functional datatypes into any codebase.  It 
can be included one of two ways:

**Framework**

- Drag `swiftz_core.xcodeproj` into your project tree as a subproject
- Under your project's Build Phases, expand Target Dependencies
- Click the + and add swiftz_core
- Expand the Link Binary With Libraries phase
- Click the + and add swiftz_core
- Click the + at the top left corner to add a Copy Files build phase
- Set the directory to `Frameworks`
- Click the + and add swiftz_core

**Standalone**

- Copy the swift files under `swiftz/swiftz_core/swiftz_core` into your project.

Using the full Swiftz framework works in much the same way:

- Drag `swiftz.xcodeproj` into your project tree as a subproject
- Under your project's Build Phases, expand Target Dependencies 
- Click the + and add swiftz
- Expand the Link Binary With Libraries phase
- Click the + and add swiftz
- Click the + at the top left corner to add a Copy Files build phase
- Set the directory to `Frameworks`
- Click the + and add swiftz

Introduction
------------

Swiftz draws inspiration from a number of functional libraries 
and languages.  Chief among them are [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz),
[Prelude/Base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base), [SML
Basis](http://sml-family.org/Basis/), and the [OCaml Standard
Library](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/stdlib.html).  Elements of
the library rely on their combinatorial semantics to allow declarative ideas to
be expressed more clearly in Swift.

At its most basic, Swiftz Core provides a number of common data types and
abstractions any codebase can utilize.

A small example:

```swiftz
import swiftz_core

let str : String? = .Some("Hello ")
let greeting = (+"World") <^> str // .Some("Hello World")
```

Seamless interaction with existing platform libraries is also possible with
minimal effort:

```swiftz
import Foundation
import struct swiftz_core.Result

/// result now contains either an array of file paths or the error generated by `NSFileManager`.
let result : Result<[String]> = from({ ep in
    let documentsDirectory : String = (NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.DocumentDirectory, .UserDomainMask, true)[0] as String)
    return (NSFileManager.defaultManager().contentsOfDirectoryAtPath(documentsDirectory, error: ep) as [String]?) ?? []
})
```

Swiftz can even help with expressions of nothingness or errors:

```swiftz
import swiftz_core

/// We may not be able to do what we said we'd do, but this definition compiles. At runtime, 
/// any code that invokes this function will immediately halt the program.
func provePEqualsNP() -> Proof<P, NP> {
    return undefined()
}
```

Operators
---------

Swiftz introduces the following operators at global scope

Operator | Name      | Type
-------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------
`•`      | compose   | `• <A, B, C>(f: B -> C, g: A -> B) -> A -> C`
`<|`     | apply     | `<| <A, B>(A -> B, A) -> B`
`|>`     | thrush    | `|> <A, B>(A, A -> B) -> B`
`<-`     | extract   | `<- <A>(M<A>, A) -> Void`
`∪`      | union     | `∪ <A>(Set<A>, Set<A>) -> Set<A>`
`∩`      | intersect | `∩ <A>(Set<A>, Set<A>) -> Set<A>`
`<^>`    | fmap      | `<^> <A, B>(A -> B, a: F<A>) -> F<B>`
`<^^>`   | imap      | `<^^> <I, J, A>(I -> J, F<I, A>) -> F<J, A>`
`<!>`    | contramap | `<^> <I, J, A>(J -> I, F<I, A>) -> F<J, A>`
`<*>`    | apply     | `<*> <A, B>(F<A -> B>, F<A>) -> F<B>`
`>>-`    | bind      | `>>- <A, B>(F<A>, A -> F<B>) -> F<B>`
`->>`    | extend    | `->> <A, B>(F<A>, F<A> -> B) -> F<B>`
